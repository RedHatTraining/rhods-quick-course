= Lab: Explore Data with Pandas

== Objectives

* Load data into Juypter notebooks by using RHODS and Pandas.

== Steps


1. *Open the RHODS dashboard.*

a. In a web browser, navigate to the Web Console of your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift cluster, and log in.

b. Click the applications menu in the top navigation bar of OpenShift,
then click btn:[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science].

c. If prompted, log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift credentials.


2. *Configure the workbench of your data science project.*
+
A RHODS workbench is a containerized application that includes commonly used data science tools and libraries, such as JupyterLab, Tensorflow, and PyTorch.
RHODS provides you with a collection of workbench container images, each one preconfigured and tailored to a specific data science use case.

a. Click btn:[Data Science Projects] in the left sidebar.

b. Create a data science project.
Click btn:[Create data science project].
In the modal window that opens, enter a name and click btn:[Create].
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are using Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift from the developer sandbox, then a project is already created for you.
====

c. Click the newly created project.

d. In the project page, click btn:[Create workbench] and complete the form with the following values.
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Name*
|`data-load`

|*Notebook image* - Image selection
|`Standard Data Science`

|*Notebook image* - Version selection
|Select the recommended option
|===
+
Do not modify the default values of the rest of the fields.

e. Click btn:[Create workbench].
RHODS creates the workbench and the associated persistent storage.

3. *Configure a data connection.*
+
A data connection provides the workbench with access to a storage layer.
In this demo, you use the storage layer to save the trained model.
+
Additionally, a data connection also configures RHODS Model Serving with the required settings to download the model to be served.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not have access to an S3 bucket, you can continue to the next step.
====

a. Click btn:[Add data connection].

b. In the `name` field, enter `data-load-data-connection`.

c. Complete the `AWS_*` fields  with the connection details of an S3-compatible API.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
This example uses IBM Cloud Object Storage, but you can use any storage service that provides an S3 API.
====

d. In the `Connected workbench` field, select `lab`
to assign this data connection to the `lab` workbench.

e. Click btn:[Add data connection].
This data connection injects the S3 configuration values as environement variables in the `pytorch` workbench.
RHODS restarts the worbench to inject the variables.


4. *Open the workbench and clone the repository.*
+

a. Make sure that the `lab` workbench is running and click btn:[Open].
+

b. If prompted, log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift credentials.

c. Click btn:[Allow selected permissions] to grant the workbench access to your data science project.

d. Verify that the JuyperLab interface opens in a new browser tab.

e. Click the btn:[Git] icon in the left sidebar.

f. Click btn:[Clone a repository].
+

g. Enter https://github.com/RedHatTraining/rhods-quick-course.git as the repository, and click btn:[Clone].

h. In the file explorer, navigate to the `rhods-quick-course/exercises` directory.


5. *Open the `data-pandas.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.*
